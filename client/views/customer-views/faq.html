                <h2 class="featurette-heading text-muted">What are escape rooms?</h2>
                <p class="lead"><strong>Escape rooms are live action games</strong>. Enter a room with your group,
                    find clues and solve puzzles to unravel the mysteries of the room and escape within a set time limit.
                    <strong>It's a fun and exciting rush of adrenaline</strong>. Are you up for the challenge?
                </p>

                <h2 class="featurette-heading text-muted">How does it work?</h2>
                <p class="lead">The game begins the moment you step into the room. <strong>You have 60 minutes to achieve
                    the game objective</strong>. Games do not require any special training or physical strength. Observation,
                    logic, deduction and creative thinking are key abilities. Each scenario has the main storyline and
                    sometimes secondary objectives.
                </p>

                <h2 class="featurette-heading text-muted">Who is it for?</h2>
                <p class="lead">Our escape games are for you if you love a challenge. They are NOT easy games. You'll have
                    to work with your group, solve puzzles, be creative and logical in your thinking, and focus on the task
                    at hand with the pressure of a clock ticking. <strong>It's a high energy jolt of excitement</strong>!
                </p>

                <h2 class="featurette-heading text-muted">
                    Are we actually locked in?
                </h2>
                <p class="lead">
                    No. You can exit the rooms at anytime.
                </p>

                <!-- MINIMUM AGE -->
                <h2 class="featurette-heading text-muted">What is the minimum age?</h2>
                <p class="lead">
                    There is no minimum but children under 14 years old must be accompanied by an adult.
                    Children under 14 years old will have a ton of fun, but they may not be able to solve or participate in all the puzzles.
                    Please call us at <a href="tel:18086356957">(808) 635-6957</a> if you'd like more information.

                <!-- MAX NUMBER OF PLAYERS -->
                <h2 class="featurette-heading text-muted">I have more group members than the maximum stated for a room. Can I squeeze in more people into the room?</h2>
                <p class="lead">
                    No. Unfortunately there are no exceptions for multiple reasons, from game design to occupancy. If you have more than a room's stated maximum number of players, you can split your party across two rooms by simply purchasing some tickets for each room instead of all for one room. Feel free to call us at <a href="tel:18086356957">(808) 635-6957</a> to arrange a large group schedule.
                </p>

                    Will I be paired with players outside of my party?
                </h2>
                <p class="lead">
                    No. All our games are private events.

                </h2>
                <p class="lead">
                    For reservations cancelled less than 72 hours before the scheduled game start time, a fee of $70 will be charged on the credit card used to hold the reservation.
                </p>

                    What happens if I show up late?
                </h2>
                <p class="lead">
                    We have very little wiggle room in the schedule. We will try to accomodate late arrivals, but you might have to do the room with less than the typically allotted time.

                    Do I need any special skills, equipment, ability, or knowledge?
                </h2>
                <p class="lead">
                    No. All the solutions for the puzzles are within the room. You do not need any existing knowledge of gaming, science, or magic in order to play and the games do not require physical strength or exertion. Just an inquisitive mind and observant eye!
