                                I certify that I understand this activity has potential risks including but not limited to:

                                Use of simple tools;

                                I have no physical or mental illness that precludes my participation in a safe manner for myself or others. I am not under the influence of drugs or alcohol which impairs my ability to maintain my safety awareness or endangers others.

                                I acknowledge that this Accident Waiver and Release of Liability Form will be used by the organizers of the activity in which I may participate, and that it will govern my actions and responsibilities at said activity. I agree that all staff or authorized agents may, in their sole discretion, determine it is unsafe for myself or others for my participation to continue, remove me from the premises by any lawful means.

                                In consideration of my application and permitting me to participate in this activity, I hereby take action for myself, my executors, administrators, heirs, next of kin, successors, and assigns as follows:

                                (A) I WAIVE, RELEASE, AND DISCHARGE from any and all liability, including but not limited to, liability arising from the negligence or fault of the entities or persons released, for my death, disability, personal injury, property damage, property theft, or actions of any kind which may hereafter occur to me, THE FOLLOWING ENTITIES OR PERSONS:  The directors, officers, employees, volunteers, representatives, and agents of any and all entities authorizing this activity;

                                (B) INDEMNIFY, HOLD HARMLESS, AND PROMISE NOT TO SUE the entities or persons mentioned in this paragraph from any and all liabilities or claims made as a result of participation in this activity, whether caused by the negligence of release or otherwise.

                                I acknowledge that the directors, officers, employees, volunteers, representatives, and agents of any authorizing entity are NOT responsible for the errors, omissions, acts, or failures to act of any party or entity conducting a specific activity on their behalf.

                                I hereby consent to receive medical treatment which may be deemed advisable in the event of injury, accident, and/or illness during this activity.

                                I understand while participating in this activity, I may be photographed. I agree to allow my photo, video, or film likeness to be used for any legitimate purpose this authorizing entity decides, and assigns.
