                <!-- LOCKED IN??? -->
                <h2 class="featurette-heading text-muted">
                    Are we actually locked in?
                </h2>
                <p class="lead">
                    No. You can exit the rooms at anytime.
                </p>

                <!-- MINIMUM AGE -->
                <h2 class="featurette-heading text-muted">What is the minimum age?</h2>
                <p class="lead">
                    The minimum age for public games is 14+, or 12+ with an adult.
                    While children may enjoy some puzzles, the game is designed and
                    calibrated for teens and adults.
                </p>

                <!-- MAX NUMBER OF PLAYERS -->
                <h2 class="featurette-heading text-muted">I have more group members than the maximum stated for a room. Can I squeeze in more people into the room?</h2>
                <p class="lead">
                    No. Unfortunately there are no exceptions for multiple reasons, from game design to occupancy. If you have more than a room's stated maximum number of players, you can split your party across two rooms by simply purchasing some tickets for each room instead of all for one room.
                </p>

                <!-- CLOSING THE ROOM FEE -->
                <h2 class="featurette-heading text-muted">
                    If I don't buy all the tickets for a room will I be paired with other people?
                </h2>
                <p class="lead">
                    You can choose to pay a small extra fee to "close" the room, meaning that you will not be paired with players outside of your group. Otherwise you might get paired with other players who book the same time slot.
                </p>

                <!-- REFUNDS -->
                <h2 class="featurette-heading text-muted">
                    Can I cancel a reservation?
                </h2>
                <p class="lead">
                    We do not offer refunds. However you can give your tickets to anyone you'd like -- just let us know their names and phone numbers.
                </p>

                    What happens if I show up late?
                </h2>
                <p class="lead">
                    We have very little wiggle room in the schedule. We will try to accomodate late arrivals, but you might have to do the room with less than the typically allotted time.
                </p>

                <!-- FAQ -->
                <h2 class="featurette-heading text-muted">
                    Do I need any special skills, equipment, ability, or knowledge?
                </h2>
                <p class="lead">
                    All the solutions for the puzzles are within the room. You do not need any existing knowledge of gaming, science, or magic in order to play and the games do not require physical strength or exertion. Just an inquisitive mind and observant eye!
