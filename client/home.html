                <p class="lead">Real-life room escape games (also called <em>escape rooms</em>, <em>escape games</em>, and <em>puzzle rooms</em>) are a type of live action adventure game in which people are locked in a room with other participants and have to use elements of the room to solve a series of puzzles, find clues, and escape the room within a set time limit.</p>
                <h2 class="featurette-heading">How <span class="text-muted">does it work?</span></h2>
                <p class="lead">The game begins the moment you step into the room. You have 30 to 60 minutes to fulfill your destiny within the scenario. Quests do not require any special training or physical strength. Observation, logic, deduction and creative thinking are key abilities. Each scenario has the main storyline and sometimes secondary objectives.</p>
                <h2 class="featurette-heading">Who <span class="text-muted">is it for?</span></h2>
                <p class="lead">Our escape games are for you if you love a challenge. They are <em>NOT easy games</em>. You'll have to work with your group, solve puzzles, be creative and logical in your thinking, and focus on the task at hand with the pressure of a clock ticking. It's a high energy jolt of excitement.</p>
                <p class="lead">We try to calibrate the room difficulty for adults, but teenagers 13 of age and older will enjoy the escape rooms too.</p>
